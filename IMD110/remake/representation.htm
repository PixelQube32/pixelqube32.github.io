					<h2>Symbolism</h2>

					<p>"Imperial roof decoration of highest status on the roof ridge of the Hall of Supreme Harmony."</p>

					<p>"The design of the Forbidden City, from its overall layout to the smallest detail, was meticulously planned to reflect philosophical and religious principles, and above all to symbolize the majesty of Imperial power."</p>

					<p>"Yellow is the color of the Emperor. Thus almost all roofs in the Forbidden City bear yellow glazed tiles. There are only two exceptions. The library at the Pavilion of Literary Profundity had black tiles because black was associated with water, and thus fire-prevention. Similarly, the Crown Prince's residences have green tiles because green was associated with wood, and thus growth."</p>

					<p>"The main halls of the Outer and Inner courts are all arranged in groups of three — the shape of the Qian trigram, representing Heaven. The residences of the Inner Court on the other hand are arranged in groups of six - the shape of the Kun trigram, representing the Earth."</p>

					<p>"The sloping ridges of building roofs are decorated with a line of sta uettes lead by a man riding a phoenix and followed by an imperial dragon. The number of statuettes represents the status of the building - a minor building might have 3 or 5. The Hall of Supreme Harmony has 10, the only building in the country to be permitted this in Imperial times. As a result, its 10th statuette, called a 'Hangshi', or 'anked tenth' (Pinyin: Hángshí), is also unique in the Forbidden City."</p>

<p>"The layout of buildings follows ancient customs laid down in the Classic of Rites. Thus, ancestral temples are in front of the palace. Storage areas are placed in the front part of the palace complex, and residences in the back."</p>

					<h2>Religion</h2>
					
					<p>"Religion was an important part of life for the imperial court. In the Qing Dynasty, the Palace of Earthly Harmony became a place of Manchu Shamanist ceremony. At the same time, the native Chinese Taoist religion continued to have an important role throughout the Ming and Qing dynasties. There were two Taoist shrines, one in the imperial garden and another in the central area of the Inner Court."</p>

					<p>"Another prevalent form of religion in the Qing Dynasty palace was Buddhism. A number of temples and shrines were scattered throughout the Inner Court, including that of Tibetan Buddhism or Lamaism. Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings. Of these, the Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers is one of the most important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and mandalas, placed in ritualistic arrangements."</p>
