					<h1>Pathway to Services</h1>
					<h5>Formerly the Local Access Mechanism</h5>
					
					<p class="linehigh">It's all in a name, and that is why we have changed the Local Access Mechanism to Pathway to Services! We think our new name better describes our work of linking families that have children with complex needs to supports and services in the community or to a more intensive level of care such as a hospital or residential treatment center. Patty Brown, our bi-lingual Associate, will do her best to get your child, whether it is your client or your son or daughter, on the right path to success.</p>
					
					<p class="linehigh">She can help you by triaging your specific need; for those families who have basic questions/<br />concerns, she can refer you to <a class="purple" href="http://www.infomontgomery.org"><i>info</i>MONTGOMERY.org</a>, an online database of human services <br />for mental health, after school programming, etc. She also can give you a referral to a specific program or agency that can help resolve a particular need. Or if your child or client is struggling on many levels such as failing classes, missing school, being arrested, or using drugs or alcohol, she might refer you to our Local Coordinating Council where your child/client might be eligible for Wraparound Services. For more information, please call Patty at 301.354.4905.</a></p>

					<h3>Making a Difference</h3>
					
					<p class="linehigh">Maria, a beautiful 16 year old girl, was out of control. Not attending school. Using marijuana and drinking. Repeat runaway. Hanging out with friends who were gang related. Then, one day she was incarcerated for being intoxicated after crashing a stolen vehicle. She told the arresting officer she wished she was dead. She was hospitalized and diagnosed with Mood Disorder; Adolescent Anti-social Disorder; Alcohol Abuse; and Substance Abuse. She was later referred to an evidence-based program funded by us called Multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC).</p>
					
					<p class="linehigh">Maria's foster family, who were specifically trained to help youth with emotional/behavioral <br />issues, provided a warm, nurturing family environment while addressing her specific behavioral challenges. Her therapist worked with her on her choice of friends, and on her alcohol/drug refusal skills. Her skills coach enrolled her in a volunteer program where she helped elementary school children with arts and crafts. Her family also participated in family therapy. Her mom reports that Maria is a different child thanks to MTFC and she is on track to graduate from high school.</p>
