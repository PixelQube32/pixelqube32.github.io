					<h1>Supporting Families by Preventing Delinquency</h1>
					
					<p class="linehigh">Understanding that strong family is a key protective factor against juvenile delinquency, we applied for and received federal stimulus funding of $412,223 from the Byrne-Justice Recovery Act Program through the Governor's Office for Crime Control and Prevention. This funding is to support our families who struggle with children whose behavior indicate eventual delinquency unless there is an early intervention. For the past quarter, through a process called Wraparound, which includes care coordination, building a child and family team and developing a plan of care, we have served 23 youth with the following results:</p>
					
					<h3><u>Safety and Functioning in the Community</u></h3>
					<p>Of the youth enrolled for at least 3 months, assessments show that:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>100% were not currently involved in the juvenile justice system.</li>
						<li>100% of youth did not runaway, engage in delinquent behaviors, or engage in behaviors that threatened the community.</li>
						<li>100% of youth did not exhibit any behaviors (e.g., physical harm, fire setting, and sexual aggression) that place others at risk for harm.</li>
						<li>100% of youth had no self-harmful ideations or gestures.</li>
					</ul>
