okay. first off, this may not applky to you now, but ZX could let you face the bosses of Zero 3 and 4
the next secret is that before facing Serpent, going to area N will give you a hidden boss: Omega from Zero 3. Though he's difficult, if you beat him, you'll get this mysterious rock, shaped like the symbol omega. upon beating the game, the little guy Flueve will tell you that it has properties of a Biometal
from that point you can use Model OX, which has ZX's moveset, but has an infinite overdrive, and attacks have elements.
but you must be playing on at least normal for this to work
lastly, beating the game on normal the first time, and then playing hard mode, even when you obtain ZX, you can keep your Model X form

the Model OX is a high risk, high rewards kind of secret, and facing Omega is a B**CH, so stock up with plenty of Life Tanks and max out your energy meter. you'll need it.
you can find the rock and Model X in area N

oh, probably late to say this, but here's a tip: weapons of HX, FX, anf LX cost energy, but if used right, can help progress you through the stage. PX is a gived, thanks to the radar fuction
in addition, they follow a weakness patters like so:
Flame>Ice
Thunder>Flame
Ice>Thunder
