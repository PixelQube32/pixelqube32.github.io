					<h1>Partnering with MCPS to Connect Students to Resources</h1>
					
					<p class="linehigh">MCPS guidance counselors, pupil personnel workers and instructional staff from selected middle and high schools in the Damascus, Clarksburg and Northeast clusters will be better able to connect struggling students and families with needed services and supports during this school year. MCPS awarded us a $25,000 grant to furnish school-site training on <i>info</i>MONTGOMERY, <br />our human services resource database, and accessing our Pathway to Services staff who can help problem-solve and identify and refer students/families to needed resources. Pathway to Services also refers those who qualify to various types of wraparound services funded by the County and state. As a result of this project, students/families will be connected with services that can help prevent truancy, academic failure and other risky behaviors. To learn more contact: <a href="mailto:Kiran.dixit@collaborationcouncil.org" class="purple">Kiran Dixit</a>.</p>
					
					<h4>Funding Program to Actively Link Youth to Diversion Programs</h4>
					
					<p class="linehigh">Through our Equal Justice for All Youth focus area, our Disproportionate Minority Contact Reduction Committee continues to work to ensure youth, regardless of race/ethnicity, experience the same outcomes within our juvenile justice system. In its research, the Disproportionate Minority Contact Reduction Committee found that families of youth who had been charged with an offense needed individualized outreach to help them understand and respond to diversion options offered through the Montgomery County Police Department. Through state funding, we are contracting with Lead4Life to contact families referred by MCPD to explain the options and get youth enrolled. In the past 18 months, the Linking Youth to Diversion Options program has served 250 youth, 96% of which were first time offenders. Of those families working with the juvenile case worker who were in compliance with diversion options, 75% were diverted from being referred to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. To learn more contact: <a class="purple" href="mailto:Elijah.wheeler@collaborationcouncil.org"> Elijah Wheeler</a>.</p>
