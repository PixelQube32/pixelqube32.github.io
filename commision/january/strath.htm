					<h1>Secured 21st Century Learning Center Grant for Strathmore Elementary School</h1>
					
					<p class="linehigh">Forty-five Strathmore Elementary School students are participating in the One Dream Academy, <br />a new afterschool program that is a combination of science/math academic intervention and enrichment along with character education and recreation activities. The Maryland State Department of Education awarded a 21st Century Community Learning Center Grant (CCLC) <br /> for $210,522 to the Collaboration Council in partnership with Strathmore Elementary School.</p>
					
					<p class="linehigh">Students attend Monday-Thursday weekly from 3:30p.m. until 5:30p.m.; boxed meal and transportation home provided. Parent engagement activities include family events and frequent communication about how they can support their student's learning. In addition to teachers, community-based Passion for Learning and Peer2Peer Tutors are partners in serving the students.</p>

					<p class="linehigh">These highly competitive grants are for three years, given Federal funding. As part of Excel Beyond the Bell and the Kennedy Cluster Project, we are pleased to bring these new resources <br /> to a school where over half of its students are low income.

							<h3>Did You Know?</h3>
								<p>Did you know strong families help protect children from a life of crime? We need to stop risky behaviors from escalating. &nbsp &nbsp We need to prevent future involvement with police. We need to support families who are struggling with poverty, &nbsp &nbsp and isolation created by cultural/language barriers. We are doing just that by wrapping community services around children and their families, thanks to funding from the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention.
