					<h1>Funding Program to Actively Link Youth to Diversion Programs</h1>
					<p class="linehigh">Through our Equal Justice for All Youth focus area, our Disproportionate Minority Contact (DMC) Committee continues to work to ensure youth, regardless of race/ethnicity, experience the same outcomes within our juvenile justice system. In its research, the DMC Committee foundthat families of youth who had been charged with an offense needed individualized outreach to help them understand and respond to diversion options offered through the Montgomery County Police Department. Through state funding, we are contracting with Lead4Life to contact families referred by MCPD to explain the options and get youth enrolled. In the past 18 months, the Linking Youth to Diversion Options program has served 250 youth, 96% which were first time offenders. Of those families working with the juvenile case worker who were in compliance with diversion options, 75% were diverted from being referred to the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services. To learn more contact: <a href="mailto:Elijah.wheeler@collaborationcouncil.org"> Elijah Wheeler</a>.</p>
